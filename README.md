# Better-Reads

## User Story

AS a book enthusiast
I WANT TO compile a list of books in a book tracker
SO THAT I can see what books I have and have not read

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN A book tracker
WHEN I add a book to the 'To Read' list
THEN it appears with a checkbox that can be clicked when the book has been read
WHEN the checkbox is clicked
THEN a pop up box appears asking the user to submit a rating and any comment about the book they may have
WHEN the rating and comments have been added and the submit button is clicked
THEN the book is moved to the 'Completed' list
